# QwiPy - Quick Web Interfaces in Python
## Client-side rendering framework for Python 3.5+
=================================

# QwiPy 0.0.1

Quick Web Interfacing (QwiPy) for Python 3.5+ is a client-side rendering framework for Python 3.5+ using async/await handlers. Though the project is in it's early stages, the basic idea is to render inside the client using these handlers to pass lists as continuous IOStreams directly to and from the client.
